## Instabug plugin
Instabug is an in-app feedback and bug reporting tool for mobile apps. With just a simple shake, your users or beta testers can report bugs or send in-app feedback and the SDK will capture an environment snapshot of your user's device including all console logs, server-side network requests and bug reproduction steps compiling all these details in one organised dashboard to help you debug and fix bugs faster.

## Installation
Smartface Instabug plugin can be installed via npm easily from our public npm repository. The installation is straightforward via the  Smartface Cloud IDE.

- Run command `(cd ~/workspace/scripts && npm i -S sf-plugin-instabug)`

### iOS
- Add Instabug plugin config to **config/project.json** under *build/input/ios/plugins*.
```javascript
"instabugios": {
    "url": "",
    "path": "plugins/iOS/instabugios.zip",
    "active": true
}
```
- If your app doesnâ€™t readily access the microphone or the photo library, you will need to add the following keys to the config/iOS/info.plist file of your app for permissions required by Instabug.

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Need microphone access for uploading videos</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Need Library access for uploading images</string>
```

## How to use
- You can initialize the SDK by calling the .build(token,invocationEvent) in app.js file.
```javascript
const InstaBug = require("sf-plugin-instabug");
InstaBug.build("TOKEN",InstaBug.InvocationEvent.SHAKE);
```

#### Invocation Events
You can set the Instabug interface to be shown by using one of the following methods:

- Shake device
- Take a screenshot
- Tap on a floating button shown above the UI of your app
- Do a 2-finger swipe from right to left

To customize the invocation event, pass one of the values of the InstaBug.InvocationEvent enum when starting the SDK.

```javascript
InstaBug.InvocationEvent.NONE
InstaBug.InvocationEvent.SHAKE
InstaBug.InvocationEvent.FLOATING_BUTTON
InstaBug.InvocationEvent.SCREENSHOT_GESTURE
InstaBug.InvocationEvent.TWO_FINGER_SWIPE_LEFT
```

#### Shaking Threshold
If you are using the shaking gesture as your invocation event you can control the shaking treshold to activate Instabug. The values in the following example are the default ones. The higher the value the less sensitive the device will be to shaking; thus to the invocation.

```javascript
var shakingThreshold = {
	android : 350,
	iphone : 2.5,
	ipad : 0.6
}
InstaBug.setShakingThreshold(shakingThreshold);
```

#### Manual Invocation
If you want to invoke the SDK manually, use the invoke method.

```javascript
InstaBug.invoke();
```

Alternatively, instead of showing the default menu that lets the users choose what they want to do, you can invoke the Instabug interface with a specific feature. In this case, the "How can we help you?" popup will not appear.

```javascript
InstaBug.invokeWithInvocationMode(InstaBug.InvocationMode.NEW_BUG);
```

Below are the available invocation modes:

```javascript
InstaBug.InvocationMode.NEW_BUG
InstaBug.InvocationMode.NEW_FEEDBACK
InstaBug.InvocationMode.NEW_CHAT
InstaBug.InvocationMode.CHATS_LIST
```

The following method dismisses all visible Instabug views:

```javascript
InstaBug.dismiss();
```

#### Color Theme

The Instabug interface  has 2 color themes: light and dark. You can set which theme to use with the following method.

```javascript
InstaBug.setTheme(InstaBug.Theme.DARK);
```

Below are the available themes:

```javascript
InstaBug.Theme.LIGHT
InstaBug.Theme.DARK
```

#### Primary Color

You can also set the color of the interactive UI elements or call to action to match your app.

```javascript
InstaBug.setPrimaryColor(Color.WHITE);
```

#### Introductory

To show an intro message to guide users on how to use Instabug.

```javascript
InstaBug.showIntroMessage();
```

#### Prompt Options

When the user invokes the SDK with any of the previously discussed gestures, the prompt options popup appears. By default, it shows all the enabled features. You have control on which options are allowed and which are not by disabling and enabling any of the features. Each one can be enabled or disabled separately.

```javascript
InstaBug.setPromptOptionsEnabled(true,true,true);
```

When only a single option is enabled, it becomes the default invocation mode. If all options are disabled, bug reporting becomes the default invocation mode.

#### Language

The SDK will automatically use the device's current locale, however, you can override it with the following method

```javascript
InstaBug.setLocale(InstaBug.Locale.English);
```

Below are the possible locale values:

```javascript
InstaBug.Locale.Arabic;
InstaBug.Locale.ChineseSimplified;
InstaBug.Locale.ChineseTaiwan;
InstaBug.Locale.ChineseTraditional;
InstaBug.Locale.Czech;
InstaBug.Locale.Danish;
InstaBug.Locale.Dutch;
InstaBug.Locale.English;
InstaBug.Locale.French;
InstaBug.Locale.German;
InstaBug.Locale.Italian;
InstaBug.Locale.Japanese;
InstaBug.Locale.Korean;
InstaBug.Locale.Norwegian;
InstaBug.Locale.Polish;
InstaBug.Locale.Portugese;
InstaBug.Locale.PortugueseBrazil;
InstaBug.Locale.Russian;
InstaBug.Locale.Slovak;
InstaBug.Locale.Spanish;
InstaBug.Locale.Swedish;
InstaBug.Locale.Turkish;
```

#### User Email and Name

By default, Instabug prompts the user to enter their email in a report. You can set the email as a required or an optional field:

```javascript
InstaBug.identifyUser("NAME","EMAIL");
```

#### User Attributes

You can assign custom attributes to your users and they will show up on your Instabug dashboard with each report. Those attributes can later be used to filter the reports in the dashboard.

To add a new user attribute, use the following method:

```javascript
InstaBug.setUserAttribute("Age","18");
```

You can also remove the current value of a certain user attribute:

```javascript
InstaBug.removeUserAttribute("Age");
```

And retrieve user attributes:

```javascript
InstaBug.getUserAttribute("Age");
InstaBug.getAllUserAttributes();
```

#### Logout

When a user logs out, the following method should be used.

```javascript
InstaBug.logoutUser();
```

Calling logoutUser will reset the value of the email and name previously set. It will also remove any currently set user attributes, events, chats and data.
